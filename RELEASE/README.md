R-MOR is a devastating machine made for critical encounters: extreme armor, retractable blades and missile launchers. An unstoppable behemoth.

## For Skin Creators

To add custom DRONE models to your R-MOR skin, refer to mdlHANDOverclocked.prefab in the Unity project on the GitHub. The DRONE model is a disabled GameObject attached to the prefab, and the game will attempt to load the textures/mesh from that.

Basically the same as HAN-D, just without a saw.

## Installation

Place the RMOR_Reforged folder in /Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins/  

## To Do
- Better Textures
- Unlocks for alternate primary and secondary
