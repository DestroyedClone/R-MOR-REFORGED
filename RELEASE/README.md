HAN-D is a tanky melee survivor who can heal himself and his allies to stay in the fight. His melee attacks have high knockback, and comboing them properly will allow him to knock away even the heaviest enemies!

We are looking for translators! Check the languages folder on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Moffein/HAN-D_OVERCLOCKED/tree/master/language) if you would like to submit a translation for your language.

## For Skin Creators

To add custom DRONE models to your HAN-D skin, refer to mdlHANDOverclocked.prefab in the Unity project on the GitHub. The DRONE model is a disabled GameObject attached to the prefab, and the game will attempt to load the textures/mesh from that.

## Installation

Place the HAND_Overclocked folder in /Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins/  
Settings can be changed in BepInEx/config/com.EnforcerGang.HAND_Overclocked.cfg
