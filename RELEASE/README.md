R-MOR is a devastating machine made for critical encounters: extreme armor, retractable blades and missile launchers. An unstoppable behemoth.

## For Skin Creators

To add custom DRONE models to your R-MOR skin, refer to mdlHANDOverclocked.prefab in the Unity project on the GitHub. The DRONE model is a disabled GameObject attached to the prefab, and the game will attempt to load the textures/mesh from that.

Basically the same as HAN-D, just without a saw.

## Installation

Place the RMOR_Reforged folder in /Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins/  

## To Do
- New Skill Icons
- Better Textures
- Improve Animations and effects
- Unlocks for alternate primary and secondary
- Mastery Skin
- Green overlay material of Fortify

## Known Issues
- R-MOR will simply sometimes cause the game to lose frames. Most noticable on Distant Roost. Any help figuring out the cause is appreciated!
- Current M1 animation is a little buggy
If anything else is found, please contact me on the RoR2 modding server!
