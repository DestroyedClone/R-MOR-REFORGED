All that hard work you put into your run - dodging <style=cIsHealth>Stone Golem</style> lasers, getting annoyed by six thousand <style=cIsHealth>Lesser Wisps</color> spawning above your head, activating <color=#E5C962>Shrines of the Mountain</color> all for one simple result: your inventory is filled up with <color=#FFFFFF>Warbanners</color> and <color=#FFFFFF>Monster Tooth</color> necklaces which cost money.\n\nOn a god run? Great. A bunch of shitty items which add nothing to your run end up coming out of the <color=#E5C962>Chests</color> you buy. They get the benefit of your hard earned dosh that came from killing <style=cIsHealth>Lemurians</style>.\n\nAs a man who plays this game you are <style=cIsHealth>LITERALLY</style> dedicating two hours of your life to opening boxes and praying it's not another <color=#77FF16>Chronobauble</color>.
