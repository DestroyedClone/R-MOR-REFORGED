HAN-D is a tanky melee survivor who can heal himself and his allies to stay in the fight. By combining FORCED_REASSEMBLY with his primary attacks, he can knock away even the heaviest enemies!

## For Skin Creators

To add custom DRONE models to your HAN-D skin, refer to mdlHANDOverclocked.prefab in the Unity project on the GitHub. The DRONE model is a disabled GameObject attached to the prefab, and the game will attempt to load the textures/mesh from that.
