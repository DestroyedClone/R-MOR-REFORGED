An unstoppable behemoth. <style=cSub>\r\n\r\n< ! > ERADICATE is slow, but strong. It's very good at picking off weak enemies.\r\n\r\n< ! > CLUSTER_CANNON takes time to reach full strength, but is powerful when it does, launching enemies far away if it doesn't kill them outright.\r\n\r\n< ! > FORTIFY can help make up for R-MOR's low health regeneration.\r\n\r\n< ! > Cancelling FORTIFY will allow you to boost upward and reach flying enemies.\r\n\r\n< ! > Use MISSILES to deal heavy damage, at that cost of attack speed.\r\n\r\n",

Honestly, think about it rationally. You are shooting, running, jumping for like 60 minutes solely so you can get a fucking <color=#77FF16>Squid Polyp</color>. All that hard work you put into your run - dodging <style=cIsHealth>Stone Golem</style> lasers, getting annoyed by six thousand <style=cIsHealth>Lesser Wisps</color> spawning above your head, activating <color=#E5C962>Shrines of the Mountain</color> all for one simple result: your inventory is filled up with <color=#FFFFFF>Warbanners</color> and <color=#FFFFFF>Monster Tooth</color> necklaces which cost money.\n\nOn a god run? Great. A bunch of shitty items which add nothing to your run end up coming out of the <color=#E5C962>Chests</color> you buy. They get the benefit of your hard earned dosh that came from killing <style=cIsHealth>Lemurians</style>.\n\nAs a man who plays this game you are <style=cIsHealth>LITERALLY</style> dedicating two hours of your life to opening boxes and praying it's not another <color=#77FF16>Chronobauble</color>.
